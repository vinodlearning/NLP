Analysis of Failed Tests and Error Reasons
After reviewing all 210 test cases, I've identified the inputs that resulted in errors and analyzed why they failed compared to what was expected.

Summary of Failed Tests
Test 37: "acc number 1084"
Error:

Code: "MISSING_HEADER"

Message: "Provide at least one identifier (contract/part/customer) or filter (date/status)"

Reason: The input "acc number 1084" was too vague - it didn't specify whether this was a contract, part, or customer number, nor did it include any clear action or filter.

Expected: The system needed either:

A clear identifier type (e.g., "customer number 1084")

A specific query action (e.g., "show contracts for account number 1084")

A filter condition (e.g., "contracts created after 2020 for account 1084")

Test 113: "AE125_validation-fail"
Error:

Code: "MISSING_HEADER"

Message: "Provide at least one identifier (contract/part/customer) or filter (date/status)"

Reason: The input was treated as a single unparseable string rather than containing identifiable components. The underscore may have disrupted parsing.

Expected: A clearer query like:

"Why did part AE125 fail validation?"

"Show validation status for AE125"

"Find contracts where AE125 failed validation"

Test 127: "customer897654contracts"
Error:

Code: "INVALID_HEADER"

Message: "Customer number '897654contracts' must be 4-8 digits"

Reason: The system couldn't separate the customer number from the word "contracts", treating the entire string as an invalid customer number.

Expected: Clear separation like:

"contracts for customer 897654"

"customer number 897654 contracts"

Test 130: "contractSiemensunderaccount"
Error:

Code: "INVALID_HEADER"

Message: "Contract number 'siemensunderaccount' must be 6+ digits"

Reason: The system tried to interpret the entire string as a contract number rather than recognizing "Siemens" as a customer name.

Expected: A properly formatted query like:

"contracts under account Siemens"

"contracts for customer Siemens"

Test 132: "customernumber123456contract"
Error:

Code: "INVALID_HEADER"

Message: "Customer number 'number123456contract' must be 4-8 digits"

Reason: Similar to test 127, the system couldn't properly parse the components, treating the entire string as an invalid customer number.

Expected: Clear separation like:

"contract for customer number 123456"

"customer number 123456 contract details"

Test 133: "contractAE125parts"
Error:

Code: "INVALID_HEADER"

Message: "Contract number 'ae125parts' must be 6+ digits"

Reason: The system tried to interpret the entire string as a contract number rather than recognizing "AE125" as a part number.

Expected: A properly formatted query like:

"contract parts including AE125"

"find contracts containing part AE125"

Test 135: "contract456789status"
Error:

Code: "INVALID_HEADER"

Message: "Contract number '456789status' must be 6+ digits"

Reason: The system couldn't separate the contract number from the word "status", treating the entire string as an invalid contract number.

Expected: Clear separation like:

"status of contract 456789"

"contract 456789 status"

Test 159: "AE125_valid-fail"
Error:

Code: "MISSING_HEADER"

Message: "Provide at least one identifier (contract/part/customer) or filter (date/status)"

Reason: Similar to test 113, the input was treated as a single unparseable string rather than containing identifiable components.

Expected: A clearer query like:

"validation failure for AE125"

"why did AE125 fail validation?"

Test 166: "contract123;parts456"
Error:

Code: "INVALID_HEADER"

Message: "Contract number '123' must be 6+ digits"

Reason: The semicolon-separated format wasn't properly parsed, and the contract number was too short (needs 6+ digits).

Expected: Either:

A single query about one entity: "contract 123456 parts"

Or two separate queries

Test 167: "contract 123?parts=AE125"
Error:

Code: "INVALID_HEADER"

Message: "Part number 's=ae125' must be 3+ alphanumeric characters"

Reason: The URL-like format wasn't properly parsed by the system.

Expected: A natural language query like:

"parts AE125 in contract 123"

"does contract 123 include part AE125?"

Test 169: "AE125|contract123"
Error:

Code: "INVALID_HEADER"

Message: "Contract number '123' must be 6+ digits"

Reason: The pipe-separated format wasn't properly parsed, and the contract number was too short.

Expected: A natural language query like:

"is AE125 in contract 123456?"

"find contract containing AE125"

Test 178: "contract123sumry"
Error:

Code: "INVALID_HEADER"

Message: "Contract number '123sumry' must be 6+ digits"

Reason: The concatenated format wasn't properly parsed, with the system treating the entire string as an invalid contract number.

Expected: Separate words like:

"summary for contract 123456"

"contract 123456 summary"

Test 187: "AE125...contract123..."
Error:

Code: "INVALID_HEADER"

Message: "Contract number '123' must be 6+ digits"

Reason: The ellipsis-separated format wasn't properly parsed, and the contract number was too short.

Expected: A natural language query like:

"is AE125 in contract 123456?"

"find contract 123456 containing AE125"

Common Patterns in Failures
Concatenated or run-on phrases: Many failures occurred when words were concatenated without spaces (e.g., "contract123sumry") or separated by non-standard characters.

Short contract numbers: Several errors mentioned contract numbers must be 6+ digits when shorter numbers were provided.

Ambiguous identifiers: Some inputs didn't clearly specify whether numbers referred to contracts, parts, or customers.

Non-standard formats: URL-like (?parts=AE125) or pipe-separated (AE125|contract123) formats weren't properly parsed.

Recommendations for Successful Queries
Use natural language with clear separation between components

Always specify what type of number you're referring to (contract, part, customer)

Ensure contract numbers are 6+ digits

Avoid special characters or non-standard separators

Include clear action verbs (show, find, list, get)
